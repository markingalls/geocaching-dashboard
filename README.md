# Geocaching Dashboard

A small set of browser-based tools for reviewing personal geocaching data. Everything runs locally in your browser (no uploads, no backend).

## Contents

- `index.html`  
  Simple landing page that links to the tools in this repo.

- `geocaching_logbook.html`  
  A “year in review” logbook generated from a Geocaching.com Pocket Query (GPX/ZIP). Includes charts, a map, and summary tables.

## How to use

### Run online
Open the hosted version of the dashboard:

https://markingalls.github.io/geocaching-dashboard/index.html

From there, launch the Geocaching Logbook and load your Pocket Query file.

### Run locally
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (or open `geocaching_logbook.html` directly).
3. In the logbook, choose your Pocket Query `.zip` (recommended) or `.gpx`.

## Notes

- Pocket Queries require a Geocaching.com Premium membership.
- Make sure your export includes “Found it” logs.
- The logbook supports metric/imperial units, UTC offset adjustment, and a selectable year.
